      'The recent trends of information technology and immersive media is reshaping the educational landscape, with Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) emerging as transformative tools in higher education.',
    content12:
      'These technologies offer interactive, engaging, and highly visual learning experiences that significantly enhance the delivery and comprehension of complex subject matter. Moreover, they provide safe, cost-effective, and widely accessible alternatives to traditional learning environments, such as physical laboratories. Our research has explored the use of immersive technologies across diverse fields, including medical, biomedical, and accounting study programs, to support deeper understanding and active learning. In anatomy education, for example, Hanamy (Heart Anatomy) and Gama Cardiac AR, which use augmented reality and 3D visuals to focus on the heartâ€™s anatomy. Anaries (Anatomy Stories) application, leverages VR and AR to simulate cranial anatomy and includes a mini quiz designed to boost learning interactivity. Whilst, Kadavee models the human skeleton, including the head, torso, arms, and legs, in 3D visualization and virtual reality. This application enhances spatial awareness beyond what traditional cadaver-based methods typically offer. Augmented reality further enriches learning by overlaying digital content on physical models, creating interactive, and hands-on experiences.',
