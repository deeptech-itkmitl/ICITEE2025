        <p2><b>New in ICITEE 2025: Rolling Review and Open Review Policy</b></p2><p><break></break></p>
        <p className="intro">
          ICITEE 2025 follows a <strong>Rolling Review Process</strong> with an <strong>Open Review Policy</strong> to ensure high-quality submissions, provide timely feedback, and enhance transparency.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="card">
        <h2>1. Rolling Review Process</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Continuous Submission and Review Timeline</h3>
        <p2>
          ICITEE 2025 implements a rolling review process, meaning papers are reviewed as they are submitted rather than waiting for a fixed deadline. Authors will receive a decision within three weeks of submission.
        </p2>

        <h3>1.2 Decision Categories</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Accept:</strong> The paper is accepted as-is and will be included in the proceedings.</li>
          <li><strong>Revise & Resubmit (R&R):</strong> The paper is conditionally accepted, but authors must address reviewer concerns and submit a revised version within four weeks.</li>
          <li><strong>Reject:</strong> The paper does not meet the quality standards and is not eligible for resubmission.</li>
        </ul>
        <p2>
          Note: A "Revise & Resubmit" decision does not guarantee acceptance. The revised paper will undergo another review before a final decision is made.
        </p2>
      </div>

      <div className="card">
        <h2>2. Open Review Policy</h2>
        <p2>
          ICITEE 2025 adopts a <strong>Partially Open Review Policy</strong> to enhance transparency and encourage constructive discussions.
        </p2>
        <ul>
          <li>Authors can view all reviews and feedback on their papers.</li>
          <li>Reviewer identities remain anonymous to ensure fairness.</li>
          <li>Reviewers may update their evaluations based on author responses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.1 How Open Review Works</h3>
        <p2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Initial Submission:</strong> Authors submit their anonymized paper through EDAS.</li>
          <li><strong>Review Assignment:</strong> Papers are assigned to three reviewers who provide detailed feedback.</li>
          <li><strong>Rebuttal Phase:</strong> Authors receive reviews within three weeks and have four weeks to submit a rebuttal addressing reviewer comments, clarifying misunderstandings, and justifying their research decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Reviewer Updates (Optional):</strong> Reviewers may update their evaluations after considering the author’s rebuttal, but this is optional and at the reviewer’s discretion.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision:</strong> The Track Chair considers initial reviews, author rebuttals, and any reviewer updates before making a final decision on acceptance or rejection.</li>
          <li><strong>Public Review Phase:</strong> Only accepted papers and their corresponding reviews (with reviewer and author identities anonymized) will be publicly accessible. This promotes academic transparency, encourages constructive discussions, and enhances knowledge-sharing on high-quality research.</li>
        </ol>
        </p2>
        <h3>2.2 Why Open Review?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Encourages high-quality, transparent feedback.</li>
          <li>Allows the research community to engage with accepted papers and their reviews.</li>
          <li>Ensures a fair review process with accountability while protecting rejected papers.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Do NOT include author names, emails, or affiliations anywhere in the paper.</li>
          <li>Self-citations must be anonymized (e.g., use "Blind year" instead of "Smith et al., 2023").</li>
          <li>Remove identifying information from document metadata before submission.</li>
